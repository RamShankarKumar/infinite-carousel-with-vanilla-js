# INFINITE-CAROUSEL-USING VANILLA JAVASCRIPT

* Building thid carousel system really helped me to understand many different concepts in javascripts.

1. Append and Prepend the child in nodelist.
2. first-of-type css selector.
3. event deligation in detail.
4. finding closes ancestor in the event deligation process using closest() function.
